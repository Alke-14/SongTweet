# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Kevin A. Hernandez Garcia**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**SongTweet** is an android app where birds can chat with their fellow flyers like Messenger; for our purposes, the demonstration has been translated to our English language since it would only be 'chirps' 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **emojis here**
